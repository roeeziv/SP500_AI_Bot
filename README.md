# SP500_ML
This project was made by me following an online Machine Learning course.
It's ment to demonstrate my knowledge in Python Machine Learning coding using sklearn library:
- creating a basic model
- backtesting and improving accordingly.
- adjusting parameters for optimal decision trees
- improving data given for predictions and predictions method

I initiated this project due to my belief that ML and AI represent the future, and I find them immensely intriguing. I saw it as an opportunity to delve deeper into this field.
